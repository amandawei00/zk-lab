Files in this folder:

to do:
	- main.py and dis_solver.py both accomplish the same thing. Check which is the working one
	- see if you can move bk_interpolate to one folder destination so there aren't multiple copies of it
	- check to see what xn does in the bk_solve/f77/bk.f does. Do this by checking your solution with data
	- consolidate all data files from before here
	- cythonize dis_solver.py
	- 'de-classify' dis_solver.py
