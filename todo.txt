1. download lhapdf again
2. cythonize pp-pA solver
3. clean up all code
4. run fit code with DIS data
5. run BK code with three parameter configurations from lappi paper
6. make videos for three parameter configurations from lappi paper
7. compute distributions from Farid's notes with GBW model
8. compute distributions with MV model
9. make video for the fourier transform of N(r,y)
10. compute distributions using rcBK with MV initial conditions
11. in all cases, verify same behavior at large k_perp
12. change c to c^2 to avoid extra operations
13. make it possible to only edit variables in parameters.txt (user friendliness)
14. nicer way to take laplacian?

note:
* efficient way to compute integral is to integrate over zeros of Besselfunction so we can avoid oscillatory behavior
